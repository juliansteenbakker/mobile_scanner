A fast and lightweight Flutter plugin for scanning barcodes and QR codes using the device’s camera. It supports multiple barcode formats, real-time detection, and customization options for an optimized scanning experience on multiple platforms.

## Features

- Fast barcode and QR code scanning
- Supports multiple barcode formats
- Real-time detection
- Customizable camera and scanner behavior

See the [examples](example/README.md) for runnable examples of various usages, such as the basic usage, applying a scan window, or retrieving images from the barcodes.

## Installation

Add the dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```
dependencies:
  mobile_scanner: ^<latest_version>
```

Then run:

`flutter pub get`

## Configuration

### Android
This package uses by default the **bundled version** of MLKit Barcode-scanning for Android. This version is immediately available to the device. But it will increase the size of the app by approximately 3 to 10 MB.

The alternative is to use the **unbundled version** of MLKit Barcode-scanning for Android. This version is downloaded on first use via Google Play Services. It increases the app size by around 600KB.

[You can read more about the difference between the two versions here.](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/barcode-scanning/android)

To use the **unbundled version** of the MLKit Barcode-scanning, add the following line to your `/android/gradle.properties` file:
```
dev.steenbakker.mobile_scanner.useUnbundled=true
```

### iOS


Since the scanner needs to use the camera, add the following keys to your Info.plist file. (located in <project root>/ios/Runner/Info.plist)

NSCameraUsageDescription - describe why your app needs access to the camera. This is called Privacy - Camera Usage Description in the visual editor.

If you want to use the local gallery feature from [image_picker](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker), you also need to add the following key.

NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription - describe why your app needs permission for the photo library. This is called Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description in the visual editor.

Example,
```
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs camera access to scan QR codes</string>

<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs photos access to get QR code from photo library</string>
```


### macOS
Ensure that you granted camera permission in XCode -> Signing & Capabilities:

### Web

As of version 5.0.0 adding the barcode scanning library script to the `index.html` is no longer required,
as the script is automatically loaded on first use.

#### Providing a mirror for the barcode scanning library

If a different mirror is needed to load the barcode scanning library,
the source URL can be set beforehand.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
import 'package:mobile_scanner/mobile_scanner.dart';

final String scriptUrl = // ...

if (kIsWeb) {
  MobileScannerPlatform.instance.setBarcodeLibraryScriptUrl(scriptUrl);
}
```

## Usage

### Simple

Import the package with `package:mobile_scanner/mobile_scanner.dart`. The only required parameter is `onDetect`, which returns the scanned barcode or qr code.

```dart
MobileScanner(
  onDetect: (result) {
    print(result.barcodes.first.rawValue);
  },
),
```

### Advanced

If you want more control over the scanner, you need to create a new `MobileScannerController` controller. The controller contains multiple parameters to adjust the scanner.
```dart
final MobileScannerController controller = MobileScannerController(
  cameraResolution: size,
  detectionSpeed: detectionSpeed,
  detectionTimeoutMs: detectionTimeout,
  formats: selectedFormats,
  returnImage: returnImage,
  torchEnabled: true,
  invertImage: invertImage,
  autoZoom: autoZoom,
);
```

```dart
MobileScanner(
  controller: controller,
  onDetect: (result) {
    print(result.barcodes.first.rawValue);
  },
);
```

#### Lifecycle changes

If you want to pause the scanner when the app is inactive, you need to use `WidgetsBindingObserver`.

First, provide a `StreamSubscription` for the barcode events. Also, make sure to create a `MobileScannerController` with `autoStart` set to false, since we will be handling the lifecycle ourself.

```dart
final MobileScannerController controller = MobileScannerController(
  autoStart: false,
);

StreamSubscription<Object?>? _subscription;
```

Then, ensure that your `State` class mixes in `WidgetsBindingObserver`, to handle lifecyle changes, and add the required logic to the `didChangeAppLifecycleState` function:

```dart
class MyState extends State<MyStatefulWidget> with WidgetsBindingObserver {
  // ...

  @override
  void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) {
    // If the controller is not ready, do not try to start or stop it.
    // Permission dialogs can trigger lifecycle changes before the controller is ready.
    if (!controller.value.hasCameraPermission) {
      return;
    }

    switch (state) {
      case AppLifecycleState.detached:
      case AppLifecycleState.hidden:
      case AppLifecycleState.paused:
        return;
      case AppLifecycleState.resumed:
        // Restart the scanner when the app is resumed.
        // Don't forget to resume listening to the barcode events.
        _subscription = controller.barcodes.listen(_handleBarcode);

        unawaited(controller.start());
      case AppLifecycleState.inactive:
        // Stop the scanner when the app is paused.
        // Also stop the barcode events subscription.
        unawaited(_subscription?.cancel());
        _subscription = null;
        unawaited(controller.stop());
    }
  }

  // ...
}
```

Then, start the scanner in `void initState()`:

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  // Start listening to lifecycle changes.
  WidgetsBinding.instance.addObserver(this);

  // Start listening to the barcode events.
  _subscription = controller.barcodes.listen(_handleBarcode);

  // Finally, start the scanner itself.
  unawaited(controller.start());
}
```

Finally, dispose of the the `MobileScannerController` when you are done with it.

```dart
@override
Future<void> dispose() async {
  // Stop listening to lifecycle changes.
  WidgetsBinding.instance.removeObserver(this);
  // Stop listening to the barcode events.
  unawaited(_subscription?.cancel());
  _subscription = null;
  // Dispose the widget itself.
  super.dispose();
  // Finally, dispose of the controller.
  await controller.dispose();
}
```
